Source Code for Team BRK Student Robotics Competition 2015
===============================

Here is the repository for BRK's '404 (Robot Not Found)' code for the [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) Competition 2015.

You can use any part of this code for any purpose, it's MIT Licensed anyway.
If you happen to use parts for a Student Robotics competition, I'd love to hear from you and I can provide help where possible.
(Publicly, create an 'issue' or privately by [contacting me](http://simon816.hostzi.com/contact))

There is some documentation in parts of the code, mostly in the `systems` modules. However some things are left undocumented.
The code got more messy as the two day competition progressed, sorry for that!

Unfortunately, we were knocked out of the knock-out rounds early on, but we did score consistently well throughout the league matches.
If one last tweak to the code was added, I rekon we would have got much further!

That's all for now folks.
